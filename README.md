String Calculator TDD Kata
About the Project
This is a fun little project where I built a String Calculator using Java and followed TDD (Test-Driven Development). The idea is to add numbers from a string and handle various cases step by step, writing tests first and then coding.

What It Does
Handles different inputs:

Empty strings return 0.
Single or multiple numbers are added.
Supports new lines (\n) as well as commas for separating numbers.
Custom delimiters like //;\n1;2 are supported.
Throws errors for negative numbers and shows all negative values.
TDD Workflow:

Write test cases first.
Write just enough code to pass the tests.
Refactor the code to keep it clean.

How to Run
Requirements:
Java 8+
Maven
Git
